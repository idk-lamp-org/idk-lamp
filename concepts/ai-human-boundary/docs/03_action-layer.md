# 03_action-layer — 3 Axes of Action Layer

This document organizes
**the "Action Layer," which is required when AI and humans cooperate to decide on actions**.

The Action Layer exists outside of Decision Closure,
and is the minimum structure for AI and humans to "choose value together".

---

# 1. What is the Action Layer?

When AI and humans interact and try to decide something,
it eventually falls into **action**.

However, the responsibility for action always lies with humans.

Therefore, the following 3 axes exist in the Action Layer.

Known / Unknown

Acted on proposal as is / Human decided

Human themselves gave up

Code

These 3 axes are
the "minimum structure" when AI and humans collaborate.

---

# 2. Axis 1: Known / Unknown

Knowledge related to action has
the following 2 types on the human side.

### ● Known
- Know the procedure
- Have experience
- Understand what to do

In this case, the role of AI is
close to **recalling, organizing, and confirming**.

### ● Unknown
- Unfamiliar territory
- Do not know the procedure
- Insufficient material for judgment

In this case, the AI's proposal
becomes **a trigger for new action**.

However, since action in unknown territory has
**large uncertainty**,
the final judgment must always be made by humans.

---

# 3. Axis 2: Acted on Proposal as is / Human Decided

Humans choose one of the following in response to AI's proposal.

### ● Acted on proposal as is
- Adopt AI's proposal as is
- State where judgment was omitted
- Understanding of risk tends to be shallow

### ● Human decided
- Treat AI's proposal as material
- Choose with own values
- Assume responsibility for action oneself

What is important is the point that:

> **AI cannot shoulder responsibility for action**

AI can propose,
but **cannot share the weight of choice**.

---

# 4. Axis 3: Human Themselves Gave Up

The most important axis in the Action Layer.

Humans themselves may fall into the following states:

- Cannot judge
- Cannot decide
- Uncertainty is too large
- Responsibility is too heavy
- Scared of the future

This is not weakness,
but **the natural limit of human decision-making**.

This state is
the scene where the **human-side idk-lamp** should be lit.

And,

> **A judgment where humans give up is
> also a judgment that AI must not close.**

---

# 5. What the 3 Axes of the Action Layer Indicate

These 3 axes clarify
the "boundary" in collaboration between AI and humans.

Known / Unknown
→ Difficulty and uncertainty of action

Proposal as is / Human decided
→ Subject of judgment and locus of responsibility

Human also gave up
→ Human limits and necessity of idk-lamp

Code

By having these three,
collaboration between AI and humans becomes sound.

---

# 6. Relationship Between Action Layer and Decision Closure

Decision Closure is
a structure to decide **whether AI can close the judgment**.  
In BOA, it is realized in implementation as RCA / RP.

Action Layer is
**a structure for humans to assume action**.

Both complement each other as follows:

Decision Closure:
Remove judgments that AI must not close

Action Layer:
Prepare the minimum structure for humans to assume action

Code

In other words, the relationship becomes:

> **AI does not close
> Humans assume
> The Action Layer supports that boundary**

---

# 7. Summary (Short version)

- Action Layer is the minimum structure of AI + Human → Action
- 3 axes are "Knowledge," "Subject of judgment," and "Human limits"
- Responsibility for action always lies with humans
- A judgment where humans give up is one that AI also must not close
- Decision Closure and Action Layer have a complementary relationship
