# 04_relationship-with-decision-closure — Relationship with Decision Closure

This document organizes the relationship between
**ai-human-boundary (Boundary Guide for Humans)** and
**Decision Closure (Judgment Circuit Structure for AI)**.

Although they differ in purpose and the area they cover,
they are structured to complement each other.

# 1. First, the Conclusion: Not "Hierarchy" but "Difference in Role"

ai-human-boundary:
How far humans assume (Values, Uncertainty, Limits of Judgment)

Decision Closure:
How far AI can step in (Whether judgment can be closed)

Implementation

In other words, the relationship is:

- **ai-human-boundary** deals with the **Human Boundary**
- **Decision Closure** deals with the **AI Boundary**

It is not a matter of which is superior,
but **collaboration between AI + Human is established only when both are present**.

---

# 2. Differences in Areas Covered by Both

## ◆ Areas Covered by ai-human-boundary
- Human uncertainty
- Human-side idk-lamp
- Responsibility for action
- Choice of value
- Human limits
- Structure "outside" of collaboration between AI and humans

This belongs to the **Human Decision-Making Layer**.

---

## ◆ Areas Covered by Decision Closure
- Whether AI can close the judgment
- Locus of responsibility
- Reversibility
- Chain of action
- Social context
- Transition (Midway Reversal)

This belongs to the **AI Judgment Circuit Layer**.

Implementation / System Structure

ai-human-boundary is **outside of Decision Closure**,
and deals with how humans stand.

Decision Closure is the **AI-side stop structure**,
and deals with how far AI can step in.

BOA is the methodology that **realizes it in implementation**
as RCA / RP and related structures.

# 4. Why Are Both Necessary?

For AI and humans to collaborate,
the following two boundaries are necessary.

### ● ① Boundary where AI must not step in
→ Handled by Decision Closure
→ "AI must not close judgment here"

### ● ② Boundary that humans should assume
→ Handled by ai-human-boundary
→ "Humans decide from here on"

Only when these two are present,
collaboration between AI and humans becomes **safe, sound, and aligned with values**.

---

# 5. Relationship Between Both in One Word

> **Decision Closure is a structure for AI to "stop".**
> **ai-human-boundary is a structure for humans to "stand".**

It is not enough for AI to just stop;
it is necessary for humans to stand somewhere.

It is not enough for humans to just stand;
it is necessary for AI to stop somewhere.

# 6. Concrete Examples where Both Complement Each Other

## ● Case 1: Judgment with Large Uncertainty
- Human side: idk-lamp lit
- AI side: Decision Closure returns Human-Closed

→ **Both face the same direction**

---

## ● Case 2: Human Has Given Up
- Human side: Cannot judge
- AI side: Cannot close because responsibility is dispersed

→ **AI does not overstep human limits**

---

## ● Case 3: AI's Proposal is Too Smooth
- Human side: Metacognition of omitted uncertainty
- AI side: Social context arises and it cannot be closed

→ **Avoid false conviction**

# 7. Differences Between Both in a Table

| Item | ai-human-boundary | Decision Closure |
|------|--------------------|------------------|
| Target | Human | AI |
| Deals with | Assumption of Uncertainty, Value, Responsibility | Possibility of Judgment, Reversibility, Social Context |
| Purpose | Guide for humans not to break | Structure for AI not to overstep |
| Format | Guide / Understanding | Structure / Rules |
| Output | Human Stance | AI-Closed / Human-Closed |

---

# 8. Summary (Short version)

- ai-human-boundary is "Human Boundary"
- Decision Closure is "AI Boundary"
- They are not hierarchical but have different roles
- Uncertainty is handled by humans
- Closure of judgment is handled by AI
- Collaboration between AI + Human is established only when the two are present
