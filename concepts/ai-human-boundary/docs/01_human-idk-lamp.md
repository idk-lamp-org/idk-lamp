# 01_human-idk-lamp — "idk-lamp" on the Human Side

This document organizes the idea that
**humans also need an idk-lamp (a signal that judgment cannot be closed)**.

Just as AI needed an idk-lamp,
humans in the AI era also need the same structure.

# 1. Why is a "Human-side idk-lamp" Necessary?

When AI and humans think together,
humans are often placed in the following situations:

- Have material for judgment, but cannot fully decide
- Uncertainty is too large
- Cannot read future impact
- The weight of responsibility is great
- Choice of value is involved

However, humans often **silently bottle this up**.

As a result, problems such as:

- Making a decision forcibly
- Adopting AI's proposal as is
- Pretending to "be able to do it" when actually unable to judge

occur.

What is needed to prevent this is
the **Human-side idk-lamp**.

---

# 2. What the Human-side idk-lamp Indicates

The human-side idk-lamp indicates the following states:

- Cannot judge right now
- Cannot decide right now
- Uncertainty is too large right now
- Cannot assume responsibility right now
- Cannot decide the value of the choice right now

This is not weakness, but
**a signal to protect the soundness of decision-making**.

# 3. "Uncertainty" Naturally Shared Between Humans

In conversations between humans,
uncertainty is naturally shared as "atmosphere".

- The other person's hesitation
- The other person's anxiety
- The other person's sense of responsibility
- The other person's sense of betting
- The wavering of the other person's values

These are conveyed without words.

Therefore, humans can
**make decisions while sharing uncertainty**.

---

# 4. Uncertainty is Not Shared in Human + AI

AI structurally cannot do the following:

- Worry together
- Bet together
- Hold responsibility together
- Hold anxiety together
- Imagine the future together

In other words, AI **cannot become an accomplice in uncertainty**.

Therefore, unless humans say "I don't know",
AI cannot recognize that uncertainty.

---

# 5. Roles Played by the Human-side idk-lamp

The human-side idk-lamp has the following roles:

### ● ① Signal to oneself
Metacognition to recognize the fact
that "I cannot decide right now".

### ● ② Signal to AI
Convey to AI
that "it is not the stage to close the judgment".

### ● ③ Signal to surroundings (humans)
Share the state with the team and stakeholders
that "judgment should be suspended now".

### ● ④ Prevent runaway responsibility
A boundary to protect oneself
from the pressure to rush judgment.

# 6. When Should the "Human-side idk-lamp" be Lit?

In the following situations,
the idk-lamp should be actively lit:

- Basis for judgment is thin
- Future impact is large
- Choice of value is involved
- Own state is unstable
- Information is insufficient
- Responsibility is too heavy
- AI's answer is too smooth and anxious

The last item is especially important.

> The more polished the AI's answer is,
> the easier it is for humans to forget that "uncertainty is omitted".

# 7. Concrete Examples of Human-side idk-lamp Expressions

This is not a rule,
but merely "examples of expression".

- "I cannot judge right now"
- "I need a little more time to think"
- "I cannot handle this uncertainty myself"
- "Since this is a choice of value, I cannot decide immediately"
- "I suspend judgment"

What is important is
**not to be ashamed of stopping judgment**.

---

# 8. Relationship Between Human-side idk-lamp and Decision Closure

Decision Closure is
a structure to decide **whether AI can close the judgment**.  
In BOA, it is realized in implementation as RCA / RP.

Human-side idk-lamp is
a signal to decide **whether humans can close the judgment**.

Both complement each other as follows:

AI: Do not close judgments that should not be closed (Decision Closure)
Human: Do not close judgments that cannot be closed (human-idk-lamp)

Code

Only when these two are present,
collaboration between AI and humans becomes sound.

---

# 9. Summary (Short version)

- Humans also need a "Not Known Lamp" (idk-lamp)
- Uncertainty naturally shared between humans is not shared with AI
- AI cannot become an accomplice in uncertainty
- Showing a state of inability to judge is not weakness but a boundary
- The human-side idk-lamp is a structure to protect the soundness of decision-making
- An existence paired with Decision Closure
