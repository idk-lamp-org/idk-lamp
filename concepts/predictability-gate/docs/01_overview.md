# Overview — What is Predictability Gate

Predictability Gate is an **operational decision boundary**.

It exists to answer one question *before* any model is built:

> Should this decision be delegated to AI, or not?

This gate does not optimize models.
It prevents **irreversible failures caused by wrong predictions**.

Key characteristics:

- Executed in **48–72 hours**
- Applied **before** PoC or modeling
- Focuses on **responsibility, not accuracy**
- Explicitly allows the decision: **do not proceed**

Predictability Gate is not a blocker.
It is a **safety boundary** that protects operations, people, and trust.

### Context & Roots

This gate is not an isolated idea.
It is an operational outcome of long-term thinking about boundaries and responsibility.

If you want to understand **why these boundaries must exist**, see:

- **VCDesign**(https://vcdesign.org/)   — boundary-oriented design philosophy
- **idk-lamp**(https://idk-lamp.org/) — a symbol for stopping AI decisions safely
