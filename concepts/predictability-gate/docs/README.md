# predictability-gate / docs

This directory contains the operational documents behind **predictability-gate**.

These files are not tutorials or implementation guides.
They document **how to decide when AI should *not* be used**, in real operations.

## Reading order

0. `00_failure_cases.md`  
   — Why this gate exists (failure patterns that made the boundary necessary)

1. `01_overview.md`  
   — What this gate is and why it exists

2. `02_gate_definition.md`  
   — Formal definition of G1–G6

3. `03_templates.md`  
   — Field-ready templates (case card & gate form)

4. `04_scoring.md`  
   — Scoring rules and non-negotiable overrides

5. `05_irreversibility.md`  
   — How irreversible risk is judged

6. `06_sop_numeric.md`  
   — SOP for numeric time-series cases

7. `07_sop_non_structured.md`  
   — Minimum SOP for non-structured data cases

8. `08_consensus.md`  
   — How to build agreement when objections arise

9. `09_handover_non_structured.md`

These documents are intentionally minimal.
They define **boundaries**, not best practices.
