# Irreversibility

Irreversible misses include:

## Safety
- Entrapment
- Burns
- Leaks
- Runaway conditions

## Quality
- Market leakage
- Recall
- Brand damage

## Regulation
- Environmental limits
- Labor safety
- Medical / food compliance

## Assets
- Equipment destruction
- Long downtime

If these risks cannot be mitigated by logs alone,
the case must be separated.
